An image is a filesystem and parameters to use at runtime. It doesn’t have state and never changes. A container is a running instance of an image.

Docker dont need to download images every time.Its save the image at your local machine,and when you want to run the container/image docker engine pull that image from the local machine.

Following scenerio will show you the basic flow of the docker engine.


   1.checked to see if you had the software image
   2.downloaded the image from the Docker Hub (more about the hub later)
   3.loaded the image into the container and “ran” it
