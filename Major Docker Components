Major Docker Components

1) Docker needs root to work,

2) By default docker deamon listen on local unix socket called docker.sock (/var/run/docker.sock)

3) docker.sock socket file owner is root and the group is docker.

  -- we can insert the members to this docker group instead of having them root access.
  
4.) Docker filesystem on ubuntu is stored at /var/lib/docker/aufs/file

5.) Docker image filesystem on centos is at /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/file
