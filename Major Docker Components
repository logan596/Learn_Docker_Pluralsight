Major Docker Components

1) Docker needs root to work,

2) By default docker deamon listen on local unix socket called docker.sock (/var/run/docker.sock)

3) docker.sock socket file owner is root and the group is docker.

  -- we can insert the members to this docker group instead of having them root access.
